throw error if a non-const member is read-only but not marked const

the error checking should really be independent passes between stages

may need a "hoist members" step for some SV tools

packed structs are going to behave differently if bitsliced, not sure how to
deal with that... but if you can't express it in c do we care?

do a preproc if else test
